Hi, my name is Malek and I am 19 years old.
I am a software developer with a passion for computers and their environment that dates back to my childhood.
I have pursued my dream and become a full-stack developer.

In my free time, I enjoy programming web applications, taking photos, and playing the guitar.

When it comes to my work habits, I consider myself a team-oriented person because I enjoy pair programming and discussing strategies with my colleagues.
I am also goal-oriented and always determined to achieve my objectives.
I am very focused and committed to my work.

My personal goal is to gain more experience on both a personal and professional level.
I welcome criticism, as it helps me improve and grow.
