Pockets is an innovative application designed to categorize transactions within savings accounts into distinct categories known as "Pockets." 
For instance, if you are saving for a vacation while also setting aside funds for annual subscriptions, 
Pockets enables you to effectively monitor and manage your accumulated savings for each specific goal. 
This functionality allows users to maintain a clear overview of their financial progress and make informed decisions regarding their savings.

The application automatically categorizes transactions. 
Users can define keywords for each category or pocket, which will then be searched for in the descriptions of bank transactions. 
The transactions will be read via the CSV of the bank. At this time, I only support DKB CSVs, as that is the bank I use.
