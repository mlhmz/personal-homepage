Family Task Tracking is a school assignment of 6 people.

In this project, I led the backend development and contributed a lot to the frontend.

The app is about parents assigning tasks to their childs.

While creating or editing tasks, parents can set points, that their childs can recieve when they finish
the task.

Finally, parents can create rewards that their childs can redeem with their points.

After we finished the software, we renamed it for the demo to Questie because we thought,
that the name "Family Task Tracking" was a bit uncreative and boring.

A demo can be found at: [questie.xyz](https://questie.xyz)
